## Beginner

1. [Install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) - node.js is a platform that allows you to run JavaScript outside of your browser. Grasp is written in JavaScript and requires node.js to run.
1. Run `npm install -g grasp` - the `-g` flag stands for `global`, this tells npm to install Grasp globally so you can access Grasp from anywhere. If you do not have the necessary permissions, you may have to use `sudo npm install -g grasp`.
1. Type in `grasp --help` - the help information should display.
1. Done!

## Advanced

    npm install -g grasp
