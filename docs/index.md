Start off by [installing Grasp](./install).

Next, read over the [concepts behind Grasp](./concepts).

Then run `grasp --help`, or check out the [options page](./options), and get a feel for the program.

Take a quick look at the [JavaScript syntax](./syntax-js).

Then try out some [equery](./equery) on your favourite JavaScript file.

Once you've expiremented with that, take a look at [squery](./squery) and try some more complicated searches.

Finally, use what you've learned and try to [replace](./replace) one of your searches.

If you are really curious, and are considering developing a tool that uses Grasp, learn [how to use it as a library](./lib).
